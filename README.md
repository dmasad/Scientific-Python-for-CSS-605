# Scientific-Python-for-CSS-605
## Examples for guest lecture for CSS 605

This repository contains some examples I'll run through in class. To follow along, you'll need:

#### For Part A: 
The [Scientific Python toolchain](http://www.scipy.org/): in particular, [IPython](http://ipython.org/) (including the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).

**Installing:** If you're using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) or a similar pre-packaged version Scientific Python, you should be set. Otherwise, you can install all the libraries above using the `pip` command from the command line:

  ```
  pip install ipython[all]
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install pandas
  ```

To launch the IPython Notebook, just run from the command line:
  `ipython notebook`
(or use the launcher included with Anaconda)

#### For Part B:
The [Mesa ABM framework](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa). Installing it is also done with pip:
  `pip install mesa`
